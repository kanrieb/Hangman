# Hangman
This is a simple hangman game with the sole intention of helping me learn and practice Python.
There are two text files included, with a list of words that the automatic mode can choose from.
You can play against the computer (automatic) or have someone else input a word for you.
Currently only designed for the command line, future versions may have a proper game interface.
